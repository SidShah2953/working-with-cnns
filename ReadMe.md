# Tasks

## Due 16 April, 2024

1. Transfer Learning for image data using CNN
    - [x] Download about 100 images of ducks and 100 images of chickens from the internet
    Source: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10>
    - [x] In a Google Colab notebook, fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network to classify duck vs chicken and output the classification report

2. Transfer Learning for text data using Transformer
    - [x] Download the sentiment analysis dataset from <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhi8923shriv/sentiment-analysis-dataset>
    - [ ]  Build a sentiment analysis classifier to classify the sentiment into positive, neutral, and negative by fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model and print your classification report
